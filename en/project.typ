      - Replaced the old AEP schedule generator, a web application that helps students at Polytechnique Montr√©al to generate their schedule for the semester.
      - Implemented a new algorithm to generate schedules that are more balanced and optimized for students while being *up to 100x faster* for generating schedule than the previous algorithm enabling generation.
      - Improved the user interface to make it more user-friendly and accessible to all students.
      - Used a full stack Rust framework with *Leptos*, *Tailwind* and *WebAssembly* to build the application and allow to generate schedule locally instead of on the server.
